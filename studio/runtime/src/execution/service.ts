// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The execution service
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One meaning for run/status/rerun, shared by every caller.
//
// Three paths each had their own: the CLI persisted nothing and printed an
// instruction, the gateway executed handlers and wrote artifacts, the agent
// described tools as executing and waiting. Meanwhile the engine built for this
// — leases, attempts, validated transitions — had no production callers at all.
//
// State comes from replaying the episode journal, never from which files happen
// to exist. The service writes through @studio/contracts' journal, which is the
// log replay reads; studio/runtime/src/journal/ is a separate, unwired
// implementation with a different vocabulary and must not be used here.
