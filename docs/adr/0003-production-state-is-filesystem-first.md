# Production state is filesystem-first

## Status

Accepted.

## Decision

The workspace filesystem is the canonical production record because both users and Pi must be able to inspect and edit artifacts directly without synchronizing against a hidden database. Runtime changes use atomic writes, revision checks, and an append-only execution journal; the web GUI may use SQLite for indexing and search only when that index is disposable and completely rebuildable from workspace files.
